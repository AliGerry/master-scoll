# The Lords Token

The $LORDS token is the ERC20 token underpinning the Realmverse, giving a fungible method of entry and exit from the network. It is the core utility token that is essential for gameplay. It will follow a long emissions schedule which will be controlled by the growth of the network.

A hard cap of 500 million Lords has been set, with distribution highlighted in the following chart. This distribution is governed via the Bibliotheca DAO and may change depending on the direction as voted.

## Allocations

### Game emissions

The biggest tranche of $LORDS will be released via game emissions. These emissions will follow a supply curve dependent on the actions within the game. It will be released at a sustained rate to balance inflation with growth, with the expected total distribution to take at least 7 years.

### Bibliotheca DAO

The DAO retains a large proportion of the tokens which it could choose to use for any purpose.

### Development Fund

5% of the Lords is allocated to the first development fund used to build the original game.

### Journey Contract

The journey contract was the initial distribution of Lords to early Realms holders who chose to stake. An allocation of this size will not happen again.
