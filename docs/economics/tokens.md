## The Open Item Table


The project is designed around a core set of composable DAO governed contracts, extendable in the future via modules and upgrading of the core item table contracts.

## ERC20 (Fungible)

### Lords

Lords is the only erc20 token within the network. It is generated only from specific assets within the world and is crucial to the network. You must use $LORDS in order to trade on the AMM.

## ERC1155 (Semi-fungibles)

### Resources

Resources are the core fungible tokens in the network. They are can only be generated via in game NFT assets are at the center of this whole world. Resources are used to build up the world and in the process they are burnt. So they are highly inflationary and highly deflationary according to their utilisation within the network.


In the first game release 22 different tokens will exist and they will generate from the Realms. New resources will be added as the game progresses, with the first expansion coming from the Crypts NFTs.

## ERC721 (NFTS)

### Realms

Realms exist within this world as tradable NFTs on the [Marketplace](./nft-marketplace.md). If your Realm is settled you will be able to sell it whilst it is settled.

### Loot items

Inflationary contract of individual Loot items distilled with a special Layer 1 to Layer 2 contract. These inflate at a fixed rate and are available for trade and to equip onto their Character.

Balancing a game where external developers can submit core modules that affect the economy will be challenging. After the game is launched there will be a balancing committee of builders who will vote on how each new resource/item interoperates with the rest of the game.
