## A perpetual development DAO

Bibliotheca DAO exists to foster the development of on-chain games. It does this by creating games where value accures back to the DAO, which can then be used to build on existing games or develop new games.

The sinks and burns throughout the network all help to accure value to assets within the network, whilst also allowing entry points for new players to participate.
