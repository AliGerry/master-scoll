## A perpetual development DAO

![alt](/img/game/token-flow.png)

Bibliotheca DAO exists to foster the development of on-chain games. It does this by creating games where value accures back to the DAO, which can then be used to build on existing games or develop new games.

The sinks and burns throughout the network all help to accure value to assets within the network, whilst also allowing entry points for new players to participate. 


### Lords fees

All products released by the DAO have some level of value capture which is returned to the DAO. Initially, most of the $LORDS fees from the protocol will come from the AMM and in game purchases using $LORDS.

### Ethereum Fees

The NFT market will be 100% denominated in $ETH. This will allow less barrier to entry for new holders coming into the ecosystem, whilst also providing a steady flow of ETH back into the treasury.
