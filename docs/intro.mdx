It is important before you read this introduction to understand some of our overarching princibles in our game and protocol design.

# The public idea maze

Building a project in the open comes with its challenges, namely you traverse your
idea maze in public. Rarely does one come up with a perfect idea to begin with
and follow it entirely through to completion. One must experiment and realise where
their hypothesis falls short and in doing so realise what they shouldn‚Äôt do. We
have travelled down the idea maze multiple times building this game, realising
what we shouldn't be doing.

## Eternal games

Eternal games as the name suggests are eternal. They will exist for as long as the network exists. They are both persistent and ephemeral, and they are a new paradigm. In our view an eternal game must have the following properties:

- The game play is persistent there is no end
- Governance by the active players
- Not controlled by any single entity after deployment
- All the game logic exists onchain
- All the game state exists onchain

#### Onchain

When we talk about onchain we mean that every part of the game logic and the game state exists on the blockchain. There is much discussion about what the blockchain brings to games and we believe it‚Äôs strength far surpasses just financial assets. By bringing the game logic and game state onchain we create a permissionless API which allows deep interoperability with other games.

To put this in a web2 perspective, imagine if every API in existence had deep interoperability with one another. This is the vision. Just how the world runs on open APIs now, the future of gaming will exist with composable game contracts.

#### Player ownership and governance

We see a future world of co-creation between developers, players and publishers, with the line between the them becoming forever blurred. With NFTs and permissioned contracts we can allow the game to be governed by the players forever. There will however be a canonical universe of imperion and if a group of players choose they do not like the direction of the game, they can simply fork the world and run their own game state. We are heavily inspired by the work of ISAAC and the team at Dark Forest.

## Open source & cc0

It is no coincidence that linux exists on 95% of devices in the world. Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds as a unix clone and licened as an open source operating system. 40 years later, it runs on more devices than any other operating system. It was the power of open source and the ability for anyone in the world to freely contribute that built this incredible piece of software.

When you are on the bleeding edge of blockchain technology you must leverage all the mental capacity that is available in order to build the best product. Just like how linux won, we believe open source gaming will win.

### cc0 - no copyright reserved

Fractal growth of ideas, composability unlocks unexpected creativity, building in public acts as an invitation to curious people

:::note

We outline in this scroll our masterplan for realising a player owned and
player governed eternal game. This document is a work in progress and all statistics and figures are in an Alpha state. We welcome all discussion and feedback.
