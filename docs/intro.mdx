# üóùÔ∏è Preface

### Principles of our design philosophy

---

:::warning

It is important before you read this introduction to understand some of our overarching princibles in our game and protocol design.

:::

## A quest with an objective, but without an end

Like all game developers we wish to create a successful game. Success might be satisfaction at creating a well liked, enjoyable game. It might be introducing something innovative. It might be finding commercial success. It might be creating a cultural landmark.

We are driven people. We are planning to hit all of those markers of a successful game in our releases. But our quest has an additional, deeper objective.

Allow us to share our remarks upon the nascent genre of gaming we, and a small group of other studios, are building on the frontier of.

# Eternal games

Eternal Games, as the name suggests, are ever-lasting. They will exist for as long as the network they are deployed upon exists. They are both persistent and ephemeral, and they are a new paradigm in game design.

Take a moment - which games, digital or IRL, will run forever? We are all gamers deep inside, everyone just has their own flavour.

To certain degree the only eternal game that has existed is civilisation itself. The rise and fall of civilisations over time pushes humanity forward and backwards in a constant struggle to advance.

With the advent of a scalable public blockchain, only now do we have the capacity to create an eternal game.

### Ownership, governance and permissionless creativity

We see a future world of co-creation between developers, players and publishers, with the line between the them becoming forever blurred. With NFTs and permissioned contracts we can allow the game to be governed by the players forever. There will however be a canonical universe of imperion and if a group of players choose they do not like the direction of the game, they can simply fork the world and run their own game state. \*We are heavily inspired by the work of ISAAC and the Dark Forest Team.

### Creativity constraints

The relationship between computational constraints and creativity is fascinating. Finite limits on storage and processing have forced digital artists and game developers to fit their vision into the confines of the chips, controllers, displays and networks of their time.

That‚Äôs how we got the Mario theme music. That‚Äôs how we get the pixel aesthetic that is still appreciated by many today. That‚Äôs why the side scroller and platformer gameplay came to be.

Each generation bumps up against the limits of their tech and comes up with something valuable that would not have existed in a context without limitation.

### Contemporary constraints

With the foremost smart contract platform, Ethereum, both storage and computation on the network is expensive. That‚Äôs the price of security. Building games on the EVM rapidly hits hard limits, so to build rich games we must use a layer 2 system.

Layer 2 solutions change the design space. No longer are we constrained by computation, we can now abstract the data layer away from the execution layer and build without the EVM constraint.

We have chosen StarkNet to build our Eternal Game as we believe STARKS are the next paradigm in computing thanks to their unique property of compressing computation into tiny proofs. We talk about this in the final section of this scroll.

And, of course, permanence. Once deployed, a smart contract runs forever. What is designed, coded and deployed today will be available to call generations from now.

### Embracing constraints

We embrace the constraints. They fire us up. Our community and contributors arrived eyes-wide open to the dual benefits and limits of blockchain, and since the inception of our first project - ‚ÄòRealms‚Äô - fixed their gaze upon creating a truly ‚Äòon-chain‚Äô game.

Together we are designing and building an Eternal Game.

### Open source

All code within this ecosystem is open source. Players are free to fork and tweak the game they see fit, the value of the ecosytem comes from not from constraining the code, but setting it free. It is no secret to why Linux is the most used operating system in the world, it's because of its open source nature. Anyone is free to build on Linux, and anyone is free to build and extend the Realms ecosystem.

### cc0 - no copyright reserved

Unrestricted IP unlocks unexpected creativity. Building in the public invites the weird and curious to build on your creative base. Loot unlocked an open source world build which we are all still building on, and we are pushing this forward in an open gaming world.... [needs more]
