## What is Crypts and Caverns

Crypts and Caverns is a set of on-chain generative dungeon maps. Each map adds a sense of place to the Lootverse by providing areas to explore and adventure in.

Each dungeon map is unique and contains the minimum set of metadata to define a small place. Maps can contain 'Crypts' which have rooms connected by hallways or 'Caverns' which have tunnels carved into the map.

There are 9,000 dungeon maps released by threepwave on 11/21/21, a composable "primitive" for the Lootverse.

## Our plans for Crypts and Caverns

We plan to bring Crypts and Caverns dungeons onto Starknet and launch a dynamic on-chain dungeon game. 

Dungeon masters hide valuable treasures deep in their dungeons to attract aspiring Adventurers. 

The allure of treasure is strong and Adventurers come from around the land to venture into dungeons and achieve fame and fortune.

To protect their treasure, dungeon masters have placed traps, monsters, and other treacherous surprises to stop the Adventurers and loot their corpses.

Thus begins an epic on-chain game of cat and mouse.
