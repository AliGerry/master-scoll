# Bibliotheca DAO

---

## History

Bibliotheca DAO spawned from the desire to graph the Lootverse together, but has grown into something far greater with grand ambitions. It is the manifestation of our collective desire to build an alternative reality where anyone can participate. 

### hyperfocused short term goal

We are hyperfocused on delivering the first open-source eternal game built on top of STARKS (StarkNet). Once this game is thriving, the methodologies learned will be applied to the next eternal game with the long term goal of becoming the cornerstone development house for building on-chain games.

### The Team

We are a passionate team of:
- Web3 natives
- .cairo developers
- Frontier pushers
- Full-stack developers

### Funding/Treasury

**Treasury**

The treasury is currently funded by royalties on secondary sales of Realms ([OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/lootrealms) & [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org/collections/0x7AFe30cB3E53dba6801aa0EA647A0EcEA7cBe18d)).

The Bibliotheca DAO treasury can be found here: https://treasury.bibliothecadao.xyz/

**Grants into the DAO**

The DAO has received multiple grants from within the Lootverse and beyond:
- Loot DAO
- GitCoin
- StarkWare

### Our Governance

Governance of the DAO is based around the Realms NFTs, however this will be expanded in the future.

### Open source

All code within this ecosystem is open source. Players are free to fork and tweak the game as they see fit; the value of the ecosytem comes not from constraining the code, but setting it free. It is no secret as to why Linux is the most used operating system in the world; it's because of its open source nature. Anyone is free to build on Linux, and anyone is free to build and extend the Realms and Bibliotheca ecosystem. See our [Github](https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers/).

### cc0 - no copyright reserved

Unrestricted IP unlocks unexpected creativity. Building in the public invites the weird and curious to build on your creative base. Loot unlocked an open source world build which we are all still building on, and we are pushing this forward in an open gaming world. All assets within this world are CC0 and free for anyone to build on.
