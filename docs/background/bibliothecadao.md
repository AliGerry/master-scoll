# Bibliotheca DAO

#### ðŸ’¡ To design and build an open inclusive permissionless gaming ecosystem underpinned by a thriving economy.

#### ðŸ’¡ We aspire to bring millions of players and builders working together on an entirely on-chain game



## Why?

BibliothecaDAO spawned from the desire to graph all the lootverse together but has grown into something far greater with grand ambitions. It is the manifestation of our collective desire to build an alternative reality where anyone can participate.

## Our aspirations

Shepherd the development of the first open-source MMOCCG (Massively Multiplayer On-Chain Composable Game) built on top of STARKS (StarkNet). Once this game is thriving the development learned will be applied into the next eternal game with the long term goal of become the cornerstone development house for building on-chain games.


## Tokenomic structure

The Bibliotheca DAO will be encouraging development on the protocol via LORDS grants. These grants will be awarded either retroactively or actively according to the specific job completed.

## Governance structure

The DAO is governed by holders of the Realms NFTs. As the DAO evolves this will most probably change.
