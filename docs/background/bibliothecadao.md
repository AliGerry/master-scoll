# Bibliotheca DAO

## History

BibliothecaDAO spawned from the desire to graph all the Lootverse together but has grown into something far greater with grand ambitions. It is the manifestation of our collective desire to build an alternative reality where anyone can participate. 

### Our Aspirations

Shepherding the development of the first open-source MMOCCG (Massively Multiplayer On-Chain Composable Game) built on top of STARKS (StarkNet). Once this game is thriving the development learned will be applied on the next eternal game with the long term goal of becoming the cornerstone development house for building on-chain games. The initial token linking the Realmverse is $LORDS, and the current allocation (as determined by the DAO) is as follows:


### our Governance

Governance of the DAO is based around the Realm NFTs, however this will be expanded in the future.

### Open source

All code within this ecosystem is open source. Players are free to fork and tweak the game they see fit; the value of the ecosytem comes from not from constraining the code, but setting it free. It is no secret to why Linux is the most used operating system in the world, it's because of its open source nature. Anyone is free to build on Linux, and anyone is free to build and extend the Realms and Bibliotheca ecosystem.

### cc0 - no copyright reserved

Unrestricted IP unlocks unexpected creativity. Building in the public invites the weird and curious to build on your creative base. Loot unlocked an open source world build which we are all still building on, and we are pushing this forward in an open gaming world. All assets within this world are cc0 and free for anyone to build on.
