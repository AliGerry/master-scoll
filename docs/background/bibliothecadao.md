# Bibliotheca DAO

---

## History

BibliothecaDAO spawned from the desire to graph all the lootverse together but has grown into something far greater with grand ambitions. It is the manifestation of our collective desire to build an alternative reality where anyone can participate. Governance is based around the Realm NFTs in it's first iteration, however this will expand in the future.

## Our Aspirations

Shepherding the development of the first open-source MMOCCG (Massively Multiplayer On-Chain Composable Game) built on top of STARKS (StarkNet). Once this game is thriving the development learned will be applied into the next eternal game with the long term goal of become the cornerstone development house for building on-chain games.

The Bibliotheca DAO will be encouraging development on the protocol via $LORDS grants. These grants will be awarded either retroactively or actively according to the specific job completed.
