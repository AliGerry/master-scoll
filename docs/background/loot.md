## A time before loot and a time after

Loot spawned an unstoppable idea, an infinite permissionless world build. Anyone can build in this world. The idea transcends the price of a loot bag and pentrates the mind of anyone willing to create. 

## Why we build on the Loot

We choose to build within the Lootverse because we see it as a collective unhinged world build. By having a cc0 base to build off it's world will grow greater than any walled garden.

## Our plans for the lootverse
