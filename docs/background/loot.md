## A time before loot and a time after

For anyone curious about building an interconnected public domain "world", *Loot is the place to do it*. This is the first globally scaled, community steered, decentralized, composable world-building project. Bibliotheca DAO is at the heart of it, shepherding the lootverse forward technologically and strategically.

## Why we build on the Loot

We love this community, we want to build with builders, we want to build in the open, we believe in the power of loot as a "forever foundation" for a fantasy ecosystem that will grow in importance for years/decades/generations to come.

## Our plans for the lootverse
