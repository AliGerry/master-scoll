# Overview & Keypoints

---

Bibliotheca employs a variety of innovative best in class open-source technologies to create engaging user and developer experiences

## Modules
Game assets have been conceptualised to enable a modular architecture - leaning in to the blockchain's enabling of the innovative creative space of composability. The separation of various components (e.g Combat System, Building Upgrades, Troops, Resources, Adventurers) enables a new paradigm of interoperability and upgradability. Elements such as the combat module can be extended or modified, e.g adding some physics based interaction, or integrated with another on-chain games stack. Any party is able to propose a new module to the DAO to be officially adopted (and potentially earn a revenue stream), or permissionlessly create their own experience.

## StarkNet
StarkNet is a revolutionary Ethereum L2, employing STARK validity proofs to deliver an unseen level of scalability and computation on top of the security of the L1 mainnet.

## The Stack
Bibliotheca uses a wide range of technologies and programming languages to ensure the best possible experience for developers amd gamers, utilising Solidity, Cairo, React, GraphQL, Typescript and many more. The DAO provides opportunites for contribution from both within and external sources.
