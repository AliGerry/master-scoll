# Module Architecture


![alt](https://)

## Modules act as open source DLCs

The future is decentralised backends with centralised frontends. The entirety of this plan revolves around the game state being entirely on-chain which is communicated to via a client. This initial client will be managed by Bibliotheca DAO, however, anyone can come and create their own client if they choose to.

One of the core tenets of Ethereums decentralisation is that it can be accessed by multiple clients. Obviously, we are not recreating a blockchain here, but the premise is similar. The protocol is the backend, and the original React client is just one of many potential clients.

## Creators get paid
