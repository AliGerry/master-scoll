# Module Architecture
---

![module controller](/img/game/module-controller.png)

## Modules act as open source DLCs

The entirety of the game is controlled through one core module controller. Write access is determined with this contract, and all upgrades are governed by the DAO. By creating this modular structure we allow the game to expand independent of the core team. A new developer could choose to write a module that interacted with the rest of the game. The module could be proposed to the community, and on a successful vote the game expands.

### Creators get paid

We can now simulate an 'app' like store like experience for new developers. When a new developer writes a module, they could choose to bake in a micro transaction to use this contract. The developer will then be paid every time a player interacts with it.
