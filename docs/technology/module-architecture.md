# Module Architecture


![alt](https://)

## Modules act as open source DLCs

The future is decentralised backends with centralised frontends. The entirety of this plan revolves around the game state being entirely on-chain which is communicated to via a client. This initial client will be managed by Bibliotheca DAO, however, anyone can come and create their own client if they choose to.

One of the core tenets of Ethereums decentralisation is that it can be accessed by multiple clients. Obviously, we are not recreating a blockchain here, but the premise is similar. The protocol is the backend, and the original React client is just one of many potential clients.

## Creators get paid

Develop a module with microtransaction baked in. Creators are developers and gamers, and deserve to be equitably rewarded for their contributions in creating amazing experiences.

### Modules
Modules are isolated contracts written by Bibliotheca DAO or external developers that all interact with the core contracts. These core contracts form the basis for the economy and can be seen much like item tables (Diablo items etc) in a traditional game. When a new DLC happens, the item table is extended. In the Realmverse, the item table is the ERC1155 contract, and the DLC are the logic modules controlling their distribution and usage.
