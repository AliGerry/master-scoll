# StarkNet & Validity Proofs

Games are some of the most complex pieces of software that exist in the world. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is an incredible piece of low powered software, however it is not suited for heavy computation and it was never designed for it. For true onchain realities and worlds to emerge we require a new technology, and the technology that we have chosed is STARKS.

StarkNet is a validity proof generalised smart contract network in which anyone can publish smart contracts. These smart contracts create tiny proofs which are validated by external machines. Once enough of these proofs have been created by the network a batch is published onto Ethereum Mainnet. By doing this, we have can abstract the heavy computation needed for games but still retain the security guarantee of a decentralised network, Ethereum.
