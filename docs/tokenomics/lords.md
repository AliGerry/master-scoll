## Staking of Realms - Primary $LORDS Pool

When a Realm is staked it begins to earn a tribute for doing so. This tribute number starts off at a fixed rate of $LORDS per day. This fixed-rate decreases overtime every day at a compounding rate. This rate is influenced by the Realm holders decision on how they govern their land. If they manage it wisely their tribute will increase and they will earn more Lords. If they do not manage it wisely their tribute will decrease.
