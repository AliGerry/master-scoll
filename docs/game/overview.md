# Game Overview

---

> “ Empires rise and fall in the quest for control of Resources and Ancient Relics within a forever world. Maintain and defend your empire or it will fall into disarray and be consumed by enemies. “

### Onchain & eternal

Once production is live, these game will exist for the length of Ethereum. Yes, it is run on StarkNet, but the all state change will still be posted to Ethereum, this is why we choose an L2 to run the game over a sidechain.

### Resources are tradable and liquid
All the resources within this gameworld are tradable tokens. You use these resources to build up and defend your Realm.


#### Difficult player choices

Players must make difficulty choices in this game. Every action has a reaction. Build too many troops and buildings and your food supplies will be depleted. Leave your vault unprotected and you will not be able to harvest the 7 day bounty. Optimize your builds and keep your digital serfs happy in order to rule in Eternal Imperio.

#### Realms are the beginning

The game we describe in this section is the base layer for an ever evolving onchain world. It will lay the economic and social layer needed in order to build a world able to support 1m players.
