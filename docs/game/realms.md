# Realms

> #### The economy of the Lootverse exists around producers and consumers, with meta-game loops baked into the economy.

Realms are the landowners of this world; they are the primary productive asset that keeps injecting liquidity into this ever-expanding Lootverse. They go to war, form allegiances (and break them) over these resources through an on-chain raiding and pillaging game called ‘Eternal Imperio’. 


## The Origin

The 8000 Realms were procedurally generated as black and white SVG files, but have since then begun their transition into higher-fidelity renders using height maps.

## The Resources

Every Realm contains at least one/a combination of the 22 different resources discovered thus far in the Lootverse, each with their varying rarity.

## The Traits

Each Realm has a unique number of geogrpahical traits: Cities (max 21), Regions (max 7), Harbors (max 35) and Rivers (max 60).

These traits play a vital role in constraining what can be built on each Realm. 

**Cities** x **Regions** + 25 = the amount of spatial area the Realm can build on (military buildings, workers huts, store houses etc).

**Harbors** = the number of Fishing Traps that can be built.

**Rivers** = the number of Famrs that can be built.
