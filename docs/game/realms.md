# Realms

> #### The economy of the Lootverse exists around producers and consumers, with meta-game loops baked into the economy.

Realms are the landowners of this world; they are the primary productive asset that keeps injecting liquidity into this ever-expanding Lootverse. They go to war, form allegiances (and break them) over these resources through an on-chain raiding and pillaging game called ‘Imperio’. 

Each Realm contains a combination of the 22 different resources discovered thus far in the Lootverse, and has a varying amount of traits; Regions, Cities, Rivers & Harbors. There are 50 mythical Wonders spread throughout the realms, such as The Pantheon of Chaos, The Cerulean Reliquary & The Altar of Divine Will.
