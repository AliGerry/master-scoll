# Relics

[need an image]

> There are 8000 ancient Relics across the Realmverse and one exists on each Realm. 


### What is a Relic?

You can plunder a Relic by Raiding another Realm, which you’ll receive along with the Resources of a successful Raid. 

Once you have plundered a Relic, it will exist on your attacking Realm until the Relic owner successfully Raids you back - adding an incentive for retaliation. 

Relics affect your happiness rating by -20 points, which will impact your daily resource harvest yield. 

It would be wise to build a strong defensive squad to protect your valuable Relic… [defensive squad link]
