# Food production

If you want to increase your Resource production (population) or have a military to attack/defend (troops) with a higher vitality, you will need to provide your Realm with food.

### Rivers (Farms) & Harbors (Fish Traps)

Farms are constrained to the number of Rivers you have in your Realm, and Fish Traps to your Harbors.

The higher number of Farms/Fish Traps you have built, the higher yield of Wheat/Fish youâ€™ll generate. 

Each Farm/Fishing Trap generates 1000 units per day and accrues for a maximum of 3 days until they are harvested. 

### Feeding your population/troops

Once you have harvested or purchased Wheat/Fish, you are able to distribute this food to your population and troops by converting them into Store Houses. 

Unlike Farms and Fish Traps, Store Houses take up space in your building's spatial areas. The more Store Houses you build, the more space they take up, but the longer they feed your population and troops. 

### Trading food on the AMM

Once you harvest either Wheat/Fish from your Farms/Traps, you have the option to trade any excess on the AMM for $LORDS.

In turn, this provides the opportunity for other Lords to purchase them instead of having to build Farms/Traps and harvesting themselves. Either a Lord with low Rivers/Harbors or simply being time poor can benefit from this. 

Wheat and Fish will have separate markets so this will add an interesting economic factor to the game.
