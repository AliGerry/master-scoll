# Food

---

> If you want to increase your Resource production (population) or have a military to attack/defend (troops) with a higher vitality, you will need to provide your Realm with food. Food is cheap and every realm can produce (or purchase) it, but you must manage it wisely or suffer the consequences.



## Rivers (Farms) & Harbours (Fish Traps)

Farms are constrained to the number of Rivers you have in your Realm, and Fish Traps to your Harbors. The higher number of Farms/Fish Traps you have built, the higher yield of Wheat/Fish youâ€™ll generate. 
 Each Farm/Fishing Trap generates 1000 units per day and accrues for a maximum of 3 days until they are harvested. 

## Feeding your population and troops

Once you have harvested or purchased $WHEAT/$FISH, you are able to distribute this food to your population and troops by converting the food into Store Houses. 

Unlike Farms and Fish Traps, Store Houses take up space in your realms spatial area. The more Store Houses you build, the more space they take up, but the longer they feed your population and troops. Storehouse deplete at a rate according to how many troops and population you have. The greater the standing Army or buildings, the greater the consumption rate.

## Trading excess food on the AMM

Once you harvest either $WHEAT/$FISH from your Farms/Traps, you have the option to trade any excess on the AMM for $LORDS.

In turn, this provides the opportunity for other Lords to purchase them instead of having to build Farms/Traps and harvesting themselves. A Lord with low Rivers/Harbors with a penchance for raiding, or simply being time poor can benefit from this, while providing a $LORDS stream to productive farmers. 

Wheat and Fish will be traded separately, and utility related to net consuptions, will add an interesting economic factor to the game.

## Factors to consider

### Food consumption
Work Huts, military buildings and troops all consume food. The more of these you have the faster the food is depleted. If you run out of food two major things happen, your production is capped at 25 and your troops vitality is capped at 50%.
