## Generating Resources

#### How are Resources generated?

Once a Realm is settled in the game it will begin generating 25 of each Resource it has per day. This is the base amount that generates.

#### How do I increase Resource production?

By increasing the population on a Realm, you will increase the number of workers and therefore increase the Resource production. To do this you must build worker huts (see [buildings](./buildings#economic)). 

#### How do I harvest Resources?

Resources accrue every day cycle within the game. Once your harvest your resources they will appear in your Iron bank. All Resources are tokens and can be traded.

#### Resource accrual cap

If you don't claim your Resources daily, they will accrue for up to 3 day cycles. After 3 days they will not longer accrue until you claim them. 

#### What do Resources do?

You use the Resources in order to build [buildings](./buildings#economic), summon [troops](./troops-squads) and trade on the [AMM](/docs/tokenomics/amm). They are the economic layer of this world and are scarce, so use them wisely.

## The Raidable Vault

Every Realm generates another stream of Resources and this stream accures directly into the realms Vault. This is what raiding Realms are after and what you need to protect. Once this vault accrues more value than 7 days of production, you are able to withdraw all of it at once, providing a hefty bonus. 

However, if you are attacked successfully, you will be depleted by 25% each time. This means you will need to wait until your vault refills until you can claim.

### Defending your vault

You must build up your defensive Army in order to protect your Vault. If you choose not defend your Vault it will never reach 7 days of production and you will never be able to claim it.

### Cool down between attacks

If you are attacked, your Realm puts up a 30m protective barrier which stops it from being attacked within that time period.

## Trade resources

#### The AMM

Resources are tradable for $LORDS via the AMM. If you have excess Resources you can trade them here for $LORDS to hold, or in turn, use to buy Resources you don't generate.
