# Resources

---

## What are Resources?

22 Resources of varying rarity have been discovered across the Realms, ranging from common Coal & Wood to the rare and magical Mithral & Dragonhide.

All settled Realms will begin producing an output of 100 of each of its resources per day, 75% of which are available for the Realm’s owner to harvest immediately, and 25% are secured in the Realm’s vault, a potential target for raiders to pillage.

## Generating Resources

#### How are Resources generated?

Once a Realm is settled in the game it will begin generating 25 of each Resource it has per day. 

#### How do I increase Resource production?

By increasing the population on a Realm, you will increase the number of workers and therefore increase the Resource production. To do this you must build worker huts (see [buildings]). The maximum Resource production is 150 per day. 

#### How do I claim Resources?

Resources are claimable every 24 hours in the game. These are then stored in your Iron Bank that can't be raided and stolen by other players. 

#### A cap on your Resource production

If you don't claim your Resources daily, they will accrue for up to 3 days. After 3 days they will not longer accrue until you claim them.

## Using resources

#### Troops

## Trade resources

#### The AMM

Resources are tradable for $LORDS via the AMM. If you have excess Resources you can trade them here for $LORDS to hold, or in turn, use to buy Resources you don't generate.

## The Raidable Vault

Every Realm generates another stream of Resources into it's Vault and accrues 50 Resources per day. This is what raiding Realms are after and what you need to protect. Once this vault accrues more value than 7 days of production, you are able to withdraw all of it. However, if you are attacked successfully, you will be depleted by 50%. This means you will need to wait until your vault refills until you can claim.
