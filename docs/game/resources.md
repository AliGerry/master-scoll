# Resources

> 22 Resources of varying rarity have been discovered across the realms, ranging from common Coal & Wood to the rare and magical Mithral & Dragonhide.

All settled Realms will begin producing an output of 100 of each of its resources per day, 75% of which are available for the Realm’s owner to harvest immediately, and 25% are secured in the Realm’s vault, a potential target for raiders to pillage.

## What do you do with Resources?

## The Vault

The 25% value is your ‘Vault’. This is what raiding Realms are after and what you need to protect. Once this vault accrues more value than 7 days of production, you are able to withdraw all of it. However, if you are attacked successfully, you will be depleted by 50%. This means you will need to wait until your vault refills until you can claim.
