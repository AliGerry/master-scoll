# Raiding

---

## Pillage other Realms for resources


Once a Realm has summoned army troops, it is able to commence a raid on any Realm belonging to a different Order. If their troops are victorious, they receive 25% of the defending realm's Vault. Realms must defend their vault (with various buildings and troops) if they do not wish to have it pillaged frequently.

## Raiding factors to consider

### Cool Down Time

To limit bots, there is a cool down period between raids. After a successful or unsuccessful raid, the attacking Army must cool down. This cool down period is at max 10 minutes and can be reduced by building more military buildings.

### More Army = More food consumption
Naturally, if you are standing a large Army your troops need to be fed. You must keep food in your storehouse at all times or else the vitality on your troops will be capped at 50%.
