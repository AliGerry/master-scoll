# Raiding

> Raiding is a key part of the Settling game, and every Realm that is staked can be raided. Capture resources, army troops and glory!

## Raiding for resources

Once a Realm has summoned army troops, it is able to commence a raid on any Realm belonging to a different Order. If their troops are victorious, they are able to claims 25% of the defending realm's Vault (50% of the resources generated by the Realm). Realms must defend their vault (with various buildings and troops) if they do not wish to have it pillaged frequently.

The walls of a Realm must be breached before raiders can attack defenders. Ranged defenders and attackers can deal damage directly before the wall has fallen. A wall has 100 vitality, 100 defense, and 1 in all other stats.
