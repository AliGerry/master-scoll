# Troops & Squads

> “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.”

## Troops

Troops are the Army that you use to raid another Realm and also use to defend your Realm. You build them up individually on each Realm before they can be used. 

NOTE: Troops are not tradable tokens. They only exist on your Realm and you cannot transfer them around. They exist to defend and attack only.

## Squads

Troops are divided into three tiers with stats weighed by the rarity of resource cost. One squad is made of 25 troops:

| Tier | Quantity |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Tier one | 16 |
| Tier two | 8 |
| Tier three | 1 |

This forms a single squad that you can use to Raid or you can just use as defense on your Realm. Tier 3 troops offer special bonuses to the whole squad.

If a troop is slain they are removed from the squad and the game.

## Squad Statistics

| Type | Effect |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Agility | Determines the squad’s travel speed and ability to escape death after defeat. |
| Attack | Determines the squad’s offensive damage against defense. |
| Defense | Determines the squad’s damage mitigation. |
| Vitality | Determines the squad’s health before death or defeat. |
| Wisdom | Determines the squad’s ability to discover rewards and solve events. |
