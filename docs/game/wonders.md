# Wonders

> 50 Wonders spread throughout the world.

Wonders are mythical buildings that demand respect. They are all unique in various ways. Who built them is unknown...

## The Wonder Tax

Wonders require upkeep so a small portion of all resources produced by each Realm are taxed when claimed, to be contributed to the upkeep of the settled Wonders of the Realms. The Lords of the Wonders will be able to claim their portion of the collections at the end of an epoch. 

The tax will be based on the total resources claimed by all the Realms that epoch. The wonder tax does not include $LORDS.
