# Buildings

> With your Resources generated, you can begin to develop and fortify your Realm. Each building will have a positive effect on one statistic but will negatively impact another. It is your job as an ruler to balance this.

## Spatial areas

Buildings take up square meters on your Realm so you must choose which ones to build.

[graphic of buildings table]

You can calculate the sqm of the Realm by:

> Regions * Cities + 25 = buildable sqm area (25 is a variable that can be adjusted)

The above formula will give you the Realm’s max building sqm (which is the constraint) and you can’t build more than this at any given time. If you have built on all available sqm, you must wait for decay to happen or demolish buildings to create space. 

## Building Decay

Buildings in the game exponentially decay over time - the more building of the same typ you have, the faster they decay.

Each building decays at a different rate, for example, Castles decay slower than a House. 

[table of buildings and decay rate]

| Building | Decay Rate (minuites) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Houses | x |
| Granary | x |
| Barracks | x |
| Archer Tower | x |
| Mage Tower | x |
