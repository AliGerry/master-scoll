# Buildings

---

> With your Resources generated, you can begin to develop and fortify your Realm. Each building will have a positive effect on one statistic but will negatively impact another. It is your job as an ruler to balance this.



---

## Spatial areas

Buildings take up square meters on your Realm so you must choose which ones to build.


You can calculate the sqm of the Realm by:

> Regions * Cities + 25 = buildable sqm area

The above formula will give you the Realm’s max building sqm (which is the constraint) and you can’t build more than this at any given time. If you have built on all available sqm, you must wait for decay to happen or demolish buildings to create space.

## Building Decay

Buildings in the game exponentially decay over time - the more building of the same type you have, the faster they decay.

Each building decays at a different rate, for example, Castles decay slower than a House. 


## Building Types

[buildings and decay time table]

### Economic

Worker Huts are building that increase your working population. The greater your popualation, the greater the output of your Resources. A consquence of having a greater population is that you will require more food otherwise your Resource generation will be capped at 25 per day - [read more here](./food)

Worker Huts have a fixed and relative cost based on the Resources the Realm has. For example, a Realm with only Wood can build a Worker Hut for 10x Wood, while a Realm with Diamonds, Sapphire and Mithral will need to pay 10 of each. 

Once you build Woker Huts they will decay, so it is not a one-time purchase. Worker Huts decay over the course of 24 hours once building, and once fully decayed the population is decreased again.

### Military

A Lord must build military buildings to unlock the ability to muster troops for raiding Realms and defending their Raidable Vault. 

There are four types of military buildings and they unlock different army units in each of the three tiers:

| Building | Decay Rate | Tier 1 Unit | Tier 2 Unit | Tier 3 Unit |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Archer House | x | Skirmisher | Longbow | Crossbow |
| Barracks | x | Pikeman | Knight | Paladin |
| Castle | x | Ballista | Mangonel | Trebuchet |
| Mage Tower | x | Apprentice | Mage | Archanist |

### Agricultual 

To keep your happiness level in a positive, a Realm Lord must ensure that there is enough food for the population at any given time. The higher the population (Worker Huts) and military units on a Realm, the more food required to maintain happiness and therefore increase Resouce output.

There are two agricultural buildings in the Realmverse and they produce two different food: Farms produce Wheat, and Fishing Traps produce Fish.
