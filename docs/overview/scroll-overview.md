### Building in the open from day 0

Bibliotheca started as a weekend hackathon in early September with RedBeard and LordOfAFew. The goal was to graph the ever-expanding loot derivatives together to create a concise dashboard of all their assets. Shortly after the site went live, the Bibliotheca team joined together with the Realms team to consolidate and expand the plan.

Since inception, all development has been completed in the open in tandem with the community, with the majority being open-source from day 1, barring some private repositories on unstable contracts.

The initial vision of combining the various interactions of adventurers in the Lootverse quickly evolved into something far greater; the vision for an ever-expanding on-chain hyperverse of interactive and fun meta-games built on a L2 network.

After much experimentation (deploying an Alpha on Arbitrum) and deliberation, StarkNet was chosen as the ideal L2 solution for its superior call data compression and composability. Inclusion for the next 1M players on-chain needs to exist in a cheap and secure transaction network, only possible due to recent L2 innovations.

The team is deep building the protocol currently with a planned release date Q2 of 2022. This release will begin with an Alpha then a Beta before production is deployed.
This collection of documents outlines our master plan for this gaming protocol.
