# Loot

In the Lootverse, the OG bags are the database of high-powered items. This high-value data layer is where lore originates and items are distilled. Due to the nature of the Ethereum mainnet, gas fees are never going to become cheap enough for serious computation to happen (games). So this presents the tricky problem of how to unleash the lore of the bags into a fun environment.

We have conceptualized the items as bags instead of characters, enabling the creation of an inflation mechanism to allow the next huge cohort of players to experience the Loot lore, explored deeper in Inflation: Loot Fountains.
