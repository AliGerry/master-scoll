# Bibliotheca DAO

#### Our Purpose

ðŸ’¡ To design and build an open inclusive permissionless gaming ecosystem underpinned by a thriving economy.

ðŸ’¡ We aspire to bring millions of players and builders working together on an entirely on-chain game



## Why we exist

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with native tokens & built-in value capture will likely come to be seen as one of the great innovations of this decade for their ability to bootstrap long-term sustainable growth. A new paradigm has emerged, where global decentralised groups are created in much shorter timeframes than was traditionally possible, and where stakeholders can be instantly aligned around a common asset.
To participate, join the discord, buy the asset and be rewarded for contributing value. The labor pool for talent is now open and willing to participants and everyone can share in the value growth, and inevitably the gap between consumer and end-product development is substantially narrowed.
We wish to realize the opportunity that DAOs offer.

## Our aspirations

Shepherd the development of the first open-source MMOCCG (Massively Multiplayer On-Chain Composable Game) of Economics and Chivalry built on top of ZK-STARKS (StarkNet) - Settling of the Realms.
Foster a thriving ecosystem built on top of the Realms/Loot economy, encompassing artistic developments, various gaming options, community building, and strategy within the ever-expanding lore of the Lootverse.

Become the cornerstone development house for building on-chain ZK Stark-based games.


## Tokenomic structure

Current allocation

The Bibliotheca DAO will be encouraging development on the protocol via LORDS grants. These grants will be awarded either retroactively or actively according to the specific job completed.

## Governance structure

- Realms as governance
