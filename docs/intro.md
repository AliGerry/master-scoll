# Preface to the Scroll
![mobius strip](/img/mobius.jpeg)

Building a project in the open comes with its challenges, namely you traverse your idea maze in public. Rarely does one come up with a perfect idea to begin with and follow it entirely through to completion. One must experiment and realise where their hypothesis falls short and in doing so realise what they shouldnâ€™t do. We have travelled down the idea maze multiple times building this game, realising what we shouldn't be doing. 

We outline in the scroll our masterplan for realising a player owned and player governed eternal game. It is important before you read this document to understand some of our overaching princibles we have taken into consideration when designing this game.
